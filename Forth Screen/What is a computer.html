          <h1>What is a Computer?</h1>
          <p>
            A computer is a device for working with information. The information can be numbers, words, pictures, movies, or sounds. 
            Computer information is also called data. Computers can process huge amounts of data very quickly. They also store and display data.
           
            People use computers every day at work, at school, and at home. Computers are used in factories to control how things are made and in offices to keep records. People also use computers for sending e-mail, writing reports, shopping, banking, 
              listening to music, and playing games. The Internet, which is a huge network of linked computers, provides information from all over the world.

          <h1> Computer Hardware and Software</h1>
          <p>
            A computer system requires both hardware and software. Hardware is the computer’s physical parts. Software is the programs, or instructions, that tell the hardware what to do.

            All computers have the same basic hardware. The microprocessor is the computer’s “brain.” It is also called the CPU, or central processing unit. The microprocessor handles all the 
            information that goes into and comes out of the computer. The memory is hardware that holds programs and data while the microprocessor uses it.

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            An English inventor named <a href="../Second Screen/Charles Bbbage.html">CharlesBabbage</a> designed the first computer in the 1830s. It was mechanical, 
            not electronic, because scientists did not yet know how electricity worked. The design called for more than 50,000 moving parts. The machine was designed to follow instructions that people entered using punched cards.
             It was so complex that Babbage never got it built. But it is still considered to be the first computer.
