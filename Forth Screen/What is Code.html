          <h1>What is Code?</h1>
          <p>
            Coding allows us to create things such as computer software, websites, apps and video games.

            There are various types of different code, depending on what you want to develop. And different “programming languages” that each have their own set of rules. 
            But basically, coding is giving instructions to a computer in order to produce a desired outcome.

          <h1>But why is it important to learn how to code?</h1>
          <p>
            It increases problem-solving skills, job opportunities,
             critical thinking, and creativity, there are so many reasons to learn programming. 
             Understanding computers and learning the basics of coding helps children to develop an appreciation of how things work. It also teaches them how software engineers use math in order to solve problems in a logical and creative way.
              This is an important reason that coding should be taught in schools.

              <br>
            Learning to code teaches children how to think. Computer programming isn’t just about teaching how to type lines of code. 
            It is more about teaching children how to think differently. Being able to code effectively, a programmer needs to use logical thinking. 
            They need to be able to see a large problem and break it down into smaller pieces in order to solve it in an effective manner.
             This is called decomposition and is one of the key features of computational thinking.
