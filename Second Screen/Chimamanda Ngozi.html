          <h1>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
            Nigerian writer</h1>
          <p>
            Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born in Enugu, Nigeria in 1977. 
            She grew up on the campus of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where her father was a Professor and her mother was the first female Registrar. She studied medicine for a year at Nsukka and then left for the US at the age of 19 to continue her education on a different path.

            She graduated summa cum laude from Eastern Connecticut State University with a degree in Communication and Political Science.
            
            She has a Master’s Degree in Creative Writing from Johns Hopkins University and a Master of Arts degree in African History from Yale University. 
            She was awarded a Hodder fellowship at Princeton University for the 2005-2006 academic year, and a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute of Harvard University for the 2011-2012 academic year. In 2008, she received a MacArthur Fellowship.
